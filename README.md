# Kuz-Ram Simulation

**Short Summary**: This is a GUI Desktop app that plot the KUZ-RAM fragmentation curve based on some drilling and blasting parameters. Furthermore, **it handles a local database in the same app.**


#### Features:


1. ##### Local Database handling:
    - The app creates a local database with explosives properties informations. In addition, the "Estimation Tab" performs calculations based on this data:

2. ##### Estimation:

    - Based on (1) drilling and blasting parameters and (2) information gathered from database tab. The GUI performs KUZ-RAM algorithm to get the CDF Curve for KUZ-RAM estimation.
